Each subfolder within the "Udemy" folder corresponds to a specific category or course, and each folder within a category corresponds to a specific project that I am working on as part of Udemy courses. Each project folder can contain files and directories relevant to the project in question. Additionally, each project has its own README.md file that provides detailed information about the project, such as goals, technologies used, and important steps.
